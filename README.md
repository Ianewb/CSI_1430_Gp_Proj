Rules:

1. Always branch and work on local.
2. Anyone pushing to master MUST make sure they've tested their features.
3. Annouce push to master on Discord to minimize update clashes, mainly so that no two people are pushing at the same time.
4. Add to .gitignore any local/side files.
5. Clean up your own shit.
